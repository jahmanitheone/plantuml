'By default, methods and fields are automatically regrouped by PlantUML. You can use separators to define your
'own way of ordering fields and methods. The following separators are possible : -- .. == __.
'You can also use titles within the separators:
'
'--: solid line 
'..: dotted line 
'==: double line 
'__: bold dotted line
