'Sequence Digram: Basic examples
'
'The sequence -> is used to draw a message between two participants. 
'Participants do not have to be explicitly declared.
'
'To have a dotted arrow, you use -->
'It is also possible to use <- and <--. 
'That does not change the drawing, but may improve readability. Note that
'this is only true for sequence diagrams, rules are different for the other diagrams.

'-: Solid line
